# Code Challege PseudoQueue

# Create a queue using two stacks

## PsuedoQueue

### Create Pseudo Queue functionality 
- enqueue(node) : puts a node into the queue
- dequeue() : removes the node at the front of the queue and returns it

## Approach & Efficiency

I took a pretty tradition approach working from the reading assignment, 'Stacks & Queues'. 

I believe the effieciency of this will scale 1:1 with the amount of elements in the array passed. 

Each function scales at O(n) for both time and space.

## Solution

[Code](./pseudoQqueue.js)

## Queues, enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty
