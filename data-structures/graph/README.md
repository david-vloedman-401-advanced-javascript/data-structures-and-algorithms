# Code Challege Directed Graph

## Create a directed graph

Create a graph data structure that can:  
- add nodes
- add edges
- return all nodes
- get all neighbors of a node
- get the size of the graph

## Approach and Effiency 

My approach was pretty traditional, a lot of resources on this structure exist. 

- addVertex - O(1)
- addEdge - O(1)
- getNodes - O(n)
- getNeighbors - O(1)
- size - O(1)


## Directed Graph API

* addVertex(vertex) - adds a vertex or node to the graph
* addEdge(vertex, node) - adds an edge between two vertices
* getNodes() - returns all nodes within the graph
* getNeighbors() - returns all the neighboring nodes of a given node
* size() - returns the count of all nodes within the graph
* print() - prints each node and it's neighbors in list form
