# Code Challege Stack

# Create a simple stack

## Stack

### Create stack functionality 
- push(val) : given a value, creates a node with it and pushes it onto the stack
- pop() : removes the node at the front of the stack and returns its value
- peek() : returns the value of the node at the top of the stack, but leaves its position in the stack
- isEmpty() : returns a boolean stating whether or not the stack is empty

## Approach & Efficiency

I took a pretty tradition approach working from the reading assignment, 'Stacks & Queues'. 

I believe the effieciency of this will scale 1:1 with the amount of elements in the array passed. 

Each function scales at O(n) for both time and space.

## Solution

[Code](./stack.js)

## Stack, push, pop, peek, and isEmpty
