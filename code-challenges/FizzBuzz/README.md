# Code Challege FizzBuzz

## FizzBuzz a tree by adding bees

### Create binary tree classes and functionality 
  - fizzBuzzTree(tree) : Turns #s div. by 3 into Fizz, #s div by 5 into Buzz, 3 and 5 into FizzBuzz and none into the original value as a string
  - fizzBuzzNode(node) : Used by fizzBuzzTree to operate on each individual node

## Approach & Efficiency

I believe I took what would be considered a pretty traditional approach to this problem.

I believe the effieciency of this will scale 1:1 with the amount of elements in the array passed. 

Each function scales at O(n) for both time and space.
