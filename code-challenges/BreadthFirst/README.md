# Code Challege Breadth

# Add a breadth first traversal function for the binary tree

## Create a function called breadthFirst

breadthFirst(tree) : Returns a list of the values in the tree in order

## Approach & Efficiency

I believe I took what would be considered a pretty traditional approach to this problem.

I believe the effieciency of this will scale 1:1 with the amount of elements in the array passed. 

Each function scales at O(n) for both time and space.
