# Code Challege Insertion Sort

## Create an insertion sort array

## Approach & Efficiency

I believe I took what would be considered a pretty traditional approach to this problem.

I believe the effieciency of this will scale 1:1 with the amount of elements in the array passed. 

Each function scales at O(n) for both time and space.
